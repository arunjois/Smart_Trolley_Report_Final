Any achievement, be it scholastic or otherwise does not depend solely on the individual efforts but on the guidance, encouragement and cooperation of intellectuals, elders, and friends. Several personalities, in their own capacities have helped us in carrying out this project work. We would like to take this opportunity to thank them all.

We express profound gratitude to respected principal Dr. K. Mallikharjuna Babu, BMS College of Engineering for providing a congenial environment to work in. Our sincere gratitude to Dr. G Poornima, Head of the Department, Electronics and Communication Engineering for encouraging and providing this opportunity to carry out the project in the department.
We would like to thank our guide Ms. D.R. Ambika, Assistant Professor, Department of ECE who helped us in all the ways to carry out the project work. She stood beside and guided us in every step. 

We thank all our professors for providing the basic knowledge without which this project wouldn't have been possible. Last but not the least we thank our family and friends, who made their valuable support compelled us to maintain a standard throughout our endeavour.
